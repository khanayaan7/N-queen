# N-Queen Visualizer
Welcome to the N-Queen Visualizer! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ‘‘ This project offers an interactive and visual approach to understanding the classic N-Queens problem in computer science and algorithm design.

 # Overview
The N-Queens problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem where the goal is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This visualizer allows users to see different solutions to the N-Queens problem in real-time. It features various algorithms for solving the problem and provides an intuitive and educational experience for exploring this fascinating challenge.
